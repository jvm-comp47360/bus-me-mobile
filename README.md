# BusMe (Mobile)
This is a React Native version of the BusMe web application, which runs on both iOS and Android.
It is currently not as fully featured as the website version, but still contains a fully functional minimum viable product. 
It is a prototype showing how the conversion from web to mobile would work.

# How to Use:
